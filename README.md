Many people find it tricky to work with Sim800L(including me!). I tried give a solution for that. This is an alarming system utilizing Sim800L. In this case, I have used MQ2 gas sensor. But you can let your imagination do the thing and use any sensor!! Please be free to ask any questions :)

(Make sure you have connected external antenna to Sim800L and it blinks every 3 seconds)

BTW, I got a little help from this repo, you can check it out:https://github.com/ahmadlogs/rpi-pico-upy
